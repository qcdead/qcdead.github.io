		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
			<ul><h2>Welcome</h2>
				<p>Hello, this is my guide on how to port Train Simulator models into Transport Fever 2. This process is long and does involve alot of trial and error. I would heavily reccommend being profiecent in the tools required to do this process such as, Blender, LUA, and the Transport Fever 2 Model Editor. Should you not be profiecent in these tools I will attempt to do my best to explain, but their are resources on these tools at, <a href="https://www.transportfever.com/wiki/doku.php" target="_blank">TPF2 Wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.transportfever.net/" target="_blank">Transport Fever net</a>. Not to mention the countless discord servers as well.</p>

		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
		<hr>
			<ul><h2>Welcome</h2>
				<ul><p>Hello, this is my guide on how to port Train Simulator models into Transport Fever 2. This process is long and does involve alot of trial and error. I would heavily reccommend being profiecent in the tools required to do this process such as, Blender, LUA, and the Transport Fever 2 Model Editor. Should you not be profiecent in these tools I will attempt to do my best to explain, but their are resources on these tools at, <a href="https://www.transportfever.com/wiki/doku.php" target="_blank">TPF2 Wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.transportfever.net/" target="_blank">Transport Fever net</a>. Not to mention the countless discord servers as well.</p></ul>

			<h2>Setting up the Transport Fever 2 Model Editor</h2>
				<ul><p>In order to use the model editor it must first be told the directories of folders in a file you will create</p>
				<p>First create a file titled "model_editor_settings.lua" in</p>
				<hr><ul>
					<li>%APPDATA%/Transport Fever 2/ for Windows</li>
					<li>~/.local/share/Transport Fever 2 for Linux</li>
					<li>/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Transport Fever 2/ for MacOS (Steam/GOG)</li>

					</ul>
				<hr>
				<p>With the contents of</p>
				<hr><ul>
					<p>function data()</p>
					<p>return {</p>
					<p>importFbxPath = "C:/Users/YourAccountNameHere/AppData/Roaming/Transport Fever 2/fbx_import/",</p>
					<p>installPath = "",</p>
					<p>userDataPath = "D:/Steam/userdata/YourSteamIDHere/1066780/local/",</p>
					<p>}</p>
					<p>end</p>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<p>You are now able to launch the Model Editor when needed</p></ul>

				<ul><p>Using the link provided above, you will be greated with a 7z file open this in WinRAR and Extract.</p>
					<p>Open the folder approprite to your sytem type x64 (64 Bit OS) x86 (32 Bit OS) and launch NinjaRipper.exe</p>
					<p>With NinjaRipper now open select the .exe to launch TS in the railworks folder of your steam libary.</p>
					<p>Change the output directory if neccesary, then click run</p>
				</ul>			
			</ul>
		<h1>Ripping the Model from TS</h1>
		<hr>
			<ul>
			<h2>The Proccess of Ripping</h2>
			<ul>
			<p>I would heavily reccommend using the build tool within Train Simulator because when using NinjaRipper you cannot select just the meshes you want. This results in some things such as grass, tracks, and skybox getting in when not needed using a regular map would only make this issue worse.</p>
			<p>Start on an Empty map, and create a straight piece of track with the train/car (with driver) of your desire on, and press play and take control of the train</p>
			<p>Once in control of the train, go to external view and hide all UI elements. Once done press F10, your game may freeze for a moment wait until you regrain control</p>
			<p>Now check "C:\Users\YourAccountNameHere\NinjaRipper\_NinjaRipper" and make sure you have a folder from the latest date</p>
			<p>You may now close TS, you have successfully ripped to model into a useable state for blender</p>
